## Syllabus

### HIGHLIGHTS:

* **Keynotes (guest speakers from the ecosystem)** are separate from the 4 hours/week of structured sessions.
* **3 weeks per module** â†’ First 2 weeks: study, last week: **buildathon** (with office hours).
* **3 buildathons total** â†’ Participants can contribute in various ways based on what they learned, such as:
  * Writing a blog post explaining a theoretical concept in detail.
  * Implementing a cryptographic algorithm in Python.
  * Building a partial or end-to-end application using the knowledge gained.
* **Total execution time: 9 weeks.**
* **Pre-class readings** to prepare participants.
* **Classes recorded on Google Meet.**
* **Discord server** for discussions and collaboration.
* **Content in Spanish, with references and previous lectures in English.**
